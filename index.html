    <h4>Why Epicodus? Programming?</h4>
    I moved to Portland last February after relocating back to the Northwest in August. Since moving back,
    I haven't had a good sense of what I want to do in my career. Having worked mostly service-based jobs
    in my life, it is very easy for me to fall back into them, but I have never enjoyed service work.<br />
    <br />
    I've been looking for a new opportunity to try something new. Earlier this summer my cousin, who is a front-end
    web programmer, sent me a link to Epicodus' women's only class. I've considered programming as something
    I would be interested in learning and developing a career around, but when I've asked relatives about
    how to get into this field, they've mostly said that I need to either learn on my own or get a BS, then
    MS, in Computer Science. Both of these options seemed alternately daunting or financially prohibitive.<br />
    <br />
    I've fiddled around with the CSS in my tumblr before and found that I enjoyed looking for patterns and
    experimenting with the code. However, fiddling with little understanding is frustrating in my experience.
    I applied to the women's only class, but struggled to complete the tests. After working on the tests for
    several weeks, I saw that there was a part-time beginners class available and decided that this would be
    a better fit for me. This experience makes me think that programming might be something that I can become
     good at and enjoy. I'm excited to learn more about CSS, JavaScript, and beyond!<br />
    <br />
    I struggle with being self-motivated, but am very socially motivated when it comes to learning. Therefore,
    when I learned about Epicodus I was very interested, particularly because it has the iniative to specifically
    support women's careers in tech. This seemed to me like a very good environment to learn in for me and it is
    affordable.
